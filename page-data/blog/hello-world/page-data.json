How exciting!</p>\n<p>I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future. I will mostly write about the projects that I do in my free time and any tips that I learn from my work. I currently work at <a href=\"https://maqsoftware.com/\">MAQ Software</a> mainly working on <a href=\"https://databricks.com/\">Databricks</a>.</p>\n<p>Wondering about the blog, I used <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/\">starter blog</a> pack from <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">gatsby</a>. It is the best pack to start with. If you have more time use <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/\">starter lumen</a>, It has left nav bar and is more complex than the one I used. I plan to modify the starter to my needs, so starter is also fine.</p>\n<p>I’m currently working on an podcast PWA using <a href=\"https://stenciljs.com/\">stenciljs</a>. It is hosted in <a href=\"https://github.com/GuruDhanush/podcasts\">github</a>. I would be working on an RSS parser for the app and would be making an post about it soon. Until then Happy Coding ! </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","date":"February 09, 2020","description":"Excited about the new blog and the content that I write"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":null}}}
