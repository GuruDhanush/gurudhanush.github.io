This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future. I will mostly write about the projects that I do in my free time and any tips that I learn from my work. I currently work at [MAQ Software](https://maqsoftware.com/) mainly working on [Databricks](https://databricks.com/).

Wondering about the blog, I used [starter blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/) pack from [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It is the best pack to start with. If you have more time use [starter lumen](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen/), It has left nav bar and is more complex than the one I used. I plan to modify the starter to my needs, so starter is also fine.

I'm currently working on an podcast PWA using [stenciljs](https://stenciljs.com/). It is hosted in [github](https://github.com/GuruDhanush/podcasts). I would be working on an RSS parser for the app and would be making an post about it soon. Until then Happy Coding !
